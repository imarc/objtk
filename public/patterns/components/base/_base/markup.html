    This page is designed to demonstrate the available styles and patterns which can be employed when developing the user-interface for your site or application.  Additionally, this page will be used internally by developers to ensure we do not break things inadvertently.  Components are divided into sections which group together related items.  For example, <a href="#group-messages">Messages</a> contains examples of messages which your site or application might show.
